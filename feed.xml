				<title>LogicX</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;The application is made on bluemix platform and uses a flask powered backend. It uses ACE editor for the code editing, syntax highlighting and other code based features. Also it is supported by using cookie based sessions (cryptographically secured using a secret key so interference is difficult). Also the backend implements a timeout system for compiling and executing programs so as to check for infinite loops etc. 
The frontend has been augmented with bootstrap css framework for compatibility with upto tablets and large screen mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>iDabba</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Our project, named “iDabba” is a smart container which identifies what fruit/vegetable/item is kept in it ( the item has to be one of those trained for image analysis ), the surrounding temperature, humidity of the item, and its weight. All this information is visible to the user via a web app. The container designed is fuss-free, convenient and washable. We were motivated to design this project to easily solve everyday hassles in kitchens and households regarding spoilage and infestation. It can even be scaled to meet the needs of farmers and storage companies for smart storing options and act as a small-scale silo.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>CardioSol</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;CardioSol is one of the most efficient and easy ways of detecting the possible occurence of Tachycardia. Capable of detecting your heartbeat rate from the webcam, CardioSol is a must have for one’s well - being, as it carries out easy checkups at home. CardioSol does not need Internet connectivity and thus, comes to the rescue of people living in remote areas with poor internet connectivity, connecting them with suitable doctors in their city, in case they are detected with the possible occurence of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Air Pollution Measurer</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;This is an arduino based solution that can measure values from dust sensor (Sharp Dust Sensor) and Gas Sensor (MQ135) It then displays led colour in accordance with the sensor value to indicate amount of pollution, where the led blinks alternately, giving the output of both sensors visually on the same RGB led.
&lt;br /&gt;
Also you can access the Arduino code &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/virresh/air-pollution-makersbox&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
